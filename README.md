# Demo: Prepending pages with [pdf-lib](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib) shows different output in Google Chrome

This code uses [pdf-lib](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib) to add a page at the beginning of a pdf file.

Two sample pdf files provided.

The output generated for `input-working.pdf` shows fine in **Google Chrome** (tested in macOS), but **NOT** for `input-problematic.pdf`

## How to start

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

The paths of the generated output files will be printed in the console.

_Please open them with **Google Chrome** (tested in macOS) to compare the results._

The Preview app, Firefox, Safari shows the same result for both outputs.
